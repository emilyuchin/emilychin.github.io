    <h2>Origin:</h2>
    <h3>Mac and cheese, traditionally known as macaroni and cheese, was a dish that originated in southern Italy in the late 1300s. The first Americans were introduced to this dish when Thomas Jefferson came back from his journey to Italy. While he was in Italy, he bought a pasta machine and introduced it back to the Americans. As a result, the dish spread rapidly throughout North America.</h3>

  <h2>Nutrition Facts:</h2>
    <h3>Mac and Cheese is not the most healthy dish to make. For reference, I have attached the nutrition facts because this dish is known for its of carbs and dairy. Having portion control when it comes to eating mac and cheese and other meals in general are helpful for your health because they can lead to high cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is often referred to as 'bad cholesterol' because it delivers cholesterol to the body unlike high-density lipoprotein (HDL) which helps remove cholesterol from the blood stream. </h3>

  <h2>Why Is It So Popular?</h2>
    <h3>Why do Americans glorify mac and cheese so much? Well, this dish happens to be one of the first "real foods" that parents feed to toddlers. Parents can rely on it because of the soft texture and small pasta pieces to prevent choking. On top of that, mac and cheese is one of the easiest as well as cheapest meals that anyone can make. Single parents or parents that both work often have no time to prepare fancy dinners because of limited time. As a result, many rely on boxed foods or quick prepared dinners, like mac and cheese. In my opinion, mac and cheese can be serevd at a fast food restaurant to gourmet restaurants. It is one of the most populat comfort foods, no matter how you make it. Whether it is from Kraft dinners or an expensive restaurant.
