    <h2>Origin:</h2>
    <h3>Mac and cheese, traditionally known as macaroni and cheese, was a dish that originated in southern Italy in the late 1300s. The first Americans were introduced to this dish when Thomas Jefferson came back from his journey to Italy. While he was in Italy, he bought a pasta machine and brought it back to the Americas. As a result, the dish spread rapidly throughout North America.</h3>

  <h2>Why Is It So Popular?</h2>
    <h3>Why do Americans glorify mac and cheese so much? Well, this dish happens to be one of the first "real foods" that parents feed to toddlers. Parents can rely on it because of the soft texture and small pasta pieces to prevent choking. On top of that, mac and cheese is one of the easiest as well as cheapest meals that anyone can make. Single parents or parents that both work often have no time to prepare fancy dinners because of limited time. As a result, many rely on boxed foods or quick prepared dinners, like mac and cheese. In my opinion, mac and cheese can be serevd at a fast food restaurant to gourmet restaurants. It is one of the most populat comfort foods, no matter how you make it. Whether it is from Kraft dinners or an expensive restaurant.
